* README rs-space

This is an implementation of space related data protocols in the Rust language. Currently in a very, very early stage. This is a project for me to
 - Learn more Rust and it's idioms
 - Have a library for our space related programs available also in Rust (for test programs but also for operational SW)
 - Have a replacement/second possibility for the libraries used within AURIS when Haskell cannot be used (e.g. for performance reasons)

Currently, this only handles very basic CCSDS packets, but a PUS Packet implementation has already started.
